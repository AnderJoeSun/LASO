This is the master branch, and it has nothing at all. 
please switch to gh-pages branch to get the real material.

These are the hints for your convinience

	$ git clone git://github.com/limingth/LASO.git
	$ cd LASO
	LASO$ git checkout gh-pages
	LASO$ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
	LASO$ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
	LASO$ export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
	LASO$ ruby mkbok 
	(incase your ruby version should be 1.9.3 or later)


Then your can see LASO.zh.pdf in your local directory 

Also you can download [LASO.zh.pdf](http://repo.or.cz/w/mkbok.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/limingth_LASO.zh.pdf) if you do NOT have ruby running env.
